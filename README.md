Viti is an Icelandic site that shows you which streaming provider has the content you need.

The team behind Viti is Aaron Mcgrath, Ingvi Rafn & Peter Tak√°cs.

We wanted to simplify life for Icelanders, help them have a common database where you can find answers to these questions, and from the conversations between the three of us, Viti was born. 

The problem is that people have a hard time finding what they want too watch. They want to know whats available and to be able to search efficiently on a site that is clean and understandable. 

In programming the 'Viti' site we used react, vite, styled-Components, typescript, HTML/CSS and GIT. 

For all our fetches we used the TMDB API.
